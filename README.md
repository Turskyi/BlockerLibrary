Instruction for the blocker at the moment:
1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

2. Add the dependency:

dependencies {
		implementation 'com.github.User:Repo:0.1.0'
	}

3. in on–°reate in MainActvity,  add this line of code

checkIfAppIsBlocked (this, BLOCK_NAME, PROFILE_ID)

, where BLOCK_NAME and PROFILE_ID is the name of the project (BLOCK_NAME) that will need to be created in the profile (PROFILE_ID) on GitLab.com,

if the project is public, then the application will simply not allow opening.
To unlock a project, just make the project private
In general, that is enough because the application will be useless.

3. Additionally, it is possible for old users to create a Worker and add 

checkIfAppIsBlocked (AppCompatActivity (), BLOCK_NAME, PROFILE_ID)
and for example 

if (appIsBlocked (applicationContext)) {
// and prescribe what should happen to the old user application
}

4. if there is an application class, you also can add

if (appIsBlocked (this)) {
// and you write what should happen
}
